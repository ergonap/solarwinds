# solarwinds
* A collection of things I like/work on with regards to solarwinds. See this as a giant collection of knowledge.

I would also recommend looking at the following: 
- [Marc Netterfield's MyPubiicWork](https://github.com/Mesverrum/MyPublicWork) as a solid reference to what can be achieved. Some things do tend to break.
- [KMSigm'a SWQL and PS Repo](https://github.com/kmsigma/SwqlQueries) - Kevin put together a lot in here, and it's all worth looking through.
