# solarwinds
* A collection of things I like/work on with regards to solarwinds. See this as a giant collection of knowledge.

I also recommend looking at [Marc Netterfield's MyPubiicWork](https://github.com/Mesverrum/MyPublicWork) as a solid reference to what can be achieved. Some things do tend to break.
